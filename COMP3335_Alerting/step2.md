1. Side menubar toggle: This toggles the side menu, allowing you to focus on the data presented in the dashboard. The side menu provides access to features unrelated to a Dashboard such as Users, Organizations, and Data Sources.
2. Dashboard dropdown: This dropdown shows you which Dashboard you are currently viewing, and allows you to easily switch to a new Dashboard. From here you can also create a new Dashboard or folder, import existing Dashboards, and manage Dashboard playlists.
3. Add Panel: Adds a new panel to the current Dashboard.
4. Star Dashboard: Star (or unstar) the current Dashboard. Starred Dashboards will show up on your own Home Dashboard by default, and are a convenient way to mark Dashboards that youâ€™re interested in.
5. Share Dashboard: Share the current dashboard by creating a link or create a static Snapshot of it. Make sure the Dashboard is saved before sharing.
6. Save dashboard: The current Dashboard will be saved with the current Dashboard name.
7. Settings: Manage Dashboard settings and features such as Templating and Annotations.
